 *  It measures the strength of association of the cross tabulated data when both variables are measured at the ordinal level. 
 *  It makes no adjustment for either table size or ties. Values range from âˆ’1 (100% negative association, or perfect inversion)
 *  to +1 (100% positive association, or perfect agreement). A value of zero indicates the absence of association.
 *  
 *  is a measure of rank correlation, i.e., the similarity of the orderings of the data when ranked by each of the quantities.
