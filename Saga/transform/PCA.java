/**
 * Principal Component Analysis
 * 
 * uses an orthoganal transform to conver sets of possibly correlated variables(Numeric) into
 * a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components(PC).
 *  the 1st PC has the largest possible variance and followed by the next
 *  
 *  When to use
 *  Do you want to reduce the number of variables, but arenâ€™t able to identify variables
 *  to completely remove from consideration?
 *  Do you want to ensure your variables are independent of one another?
 *  Are you comfortable making your independent variables less interpretable?
